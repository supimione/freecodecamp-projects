              Jaggi Vasudev (born 3 September 1957), generally referred to as Sadhguru, is an Indian yogi and author.

              In 1992, Vasudev established Isha Foundation, which has been involved in various activities in the field of spirituality, education, and environment. The organisation has been accused of violating government rules and regulations, and undertaking populist environmental activities without any rational basis. Vasudev's sociopolitical ideology aligns with neo-liberal Hindutva (and Bharatiya Janata Party); he has attracted significant criticism for flawed understanding of realpolitik and propagation of pseudo-scientific information from a politico-religious standpoint.
              
              In 2017, he was awarded Padma Vibhushana by the Government of India for his services in the field of social services.

              Early life and education
              Born in Mysore, Karnataka, India, in a Telugu speaking family, Jaggi Vasudev was the youngest of four children – two boys and two girls. His mother was a housewife and his father an ophthalmologist with Indian Railways. Due to the nature of his father's job, the family moved frequently.

              After his schooling at Demonstration School, Mysore and Mahajana Pre-University College, he graduated from the University of Mysore with a bachelor's degree in English in 1973. Vasudev refused to pursue a post-graduate course, despite parental insistence and instead took to business.

              Spirituality
              At the age of 25, on 23 September 1982, Vasudev rode up to the Chamundi Hill and sat on a rock, where he had a 'spiritual experience'. Six weeks afterwards, he left his business to his friend and travelled extensively in an effort to gain insight into his mystical experience. After about a year of meditation and travel, he decided to teach yoga to share his inner experience.

              In 1983, he conducted his first yoga class with seven participants in Mysore. Over time, he began conducting yoga classes across Karnataka and Hyderabad traveling on his motorcycle, subsisting on the produce of his poultry farm rental and donating the collections received from yoga class.

              Family

              Jaggi Vasudev at Davos, Switzerland in 2007
              Jaggi Vasudev was married to Vijayakumari. This was Vijayakumari's second marriage. Prior to marrying Vasudev she worked in a bank. The couple had a daughter called Radhe. Vijaya Kumari died in 1997. At that time her father alleged that Vasudev had murdered her. Vasudev called the incident as 'Mahasamadhi' and claimed she had told him about it nine months before her death. Although he claimed she had attained mahasamadhi and, according to Hindu beliefs, should have been buried, Vasudev had her body cremated.
              Vasudev's daughter Radhi is a trained dancer. She married Chennai-based classical vocalist Sandeep Narayan in 2014 at Vasudev's Coimbatore ashram in ceremony attended by many Indian celebrities.
